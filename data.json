[{"id": 0, "review": "The clean and simple UI, surprisingly accurate tuning and ease of use are all good selling points for this app. Where it falls short is restrictive preset tunings, no ability to measure cents, and a 'manual' mode which seems utterly pointless. I'd really like to see the addition of cents, and give the manual tuning mode purpose by allowing us to create our own tuning presets. Nice app if you're just wanting to quickly tune to common tunings, but if you want more fine control or play in more obscure tunings, you'll have to look elsewhere.", "rating": "4"},
